      <h1> Assignment 6: Flow Mapping on FlowMapper </h1>
	  <h4> This assignment uses <a href="https://flowmapper.org">flowmapper.org </a>  to map family tree movement across the United States from 1887-1924</h4>

	  <h2>Spatial Patterns</h2>
	  <h4>Sending/Recieving Flows</h4>

	  <p>The places that receive the most flows are the western states, along with Florida, especially California
		and the Pacific northwest. The states that send the most flows are in the South and Midwest, particularly
		around Tenesse, Mississippi, and Alabama. </p>

	  <h4>General Direction of Flows</h4>
	  <p>The general direction is from east to west, which make sense because the western states were much
		newer at the time that this data represents. There are more flows between adjacent states, which can be
		seen in states starting at New York and branching through each state going west, so from New York, to
		Pennsylvania, to Ohio, to Indiana, to Illinois, and so on all the way to Texas. The exceptions are California
		and Texas, who have flows spanning multiple states. </p>

	  <h4>Flow Patterns in Relation to Location Characteristics</h4>
	  <p> We can see by the diverging color scheme what states have more flows out of the state and which states
		have more flows coming in. The node provides a representation of the volume of flows. For example, New
		Jersey has a positive net flow, but the node shows there aren’t many flows coming in or out of New
		Jersey, which is much different than Oklahoma. Oklahoma also has a positive net flow, but a high valued
		node, meaning there are a lot of people moving in and out of Oklahoma, but more people are coming than
		leaving.</p>
	  <p>Here in this map, the base polygon symbology represents the overall direction of movement throughout
		all states(east to west). The nodes show the volume of traffic (flows coming both in and out) of each state.
		The flows themselves show specific movement and direction between each state.</p>
